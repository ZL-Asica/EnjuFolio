Hi, I’m **Elara Liu**, a second-year MSCS student at **Northwestern University**, advised by **Dr. Karan Ahuja** and **Dr. Haoqi Zhang**, specializing in **Human–Computer Interaction**. I earned a B.S. with dual majors in Computer Science and Informatics from **UC Irvine**. I study how intelligent systems can be dependable partners in everyday life rather than noisy sources of friction.

My work asks how **technology can help people** follow through on intentions, build and maintain habits, and recover after lapses—while respecting attention, autonomy, and context. I like to close the loop from real-world needs to working systems: I design and build **interactive tools**, iterate on their interfaces with users, and study how they behave in the wild in domains such as **health, learning, and everyday routines**.

Across projects, I focus on **timing**, **explanation**, and **control**. I’m especially excited about language-model–driven systems and context-aware technologies that surface the right support at the right moment and make their behavior legible, auditable, and aligned with people’s well-being. I enjoy collaborating across disciplines and working with diverse teams to tackle complex, real-world problems.

I’m applying to **Fall 2026 PhD** programs in labs that blend **HCI**, **HAI**, and **health and well-being**. If your group works at this intersection, I’d love to connect.
