I am **Elara Liu**, currently a second-year MSCS student at **Northwestern University**, where I am advised by [Dr. Karan Ahuja](https://karan-ahuja.com/) and [Dr. Haoqi Zhang](https://www.haoqizhang.com/). I previously earned a B.S. in Computer Science and Informatics from **UC Irvine**. My background combines technical system building with a deep sensitivity to user context, allowing me to bridge the gap between computational capabilities and human needs.

My research sits at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Health Informatics**, and **Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)**. I study how human-centered intelligent systems can support collaborative decision-making in everyday health. My work is organized around three strategic directions: (i) ensuring **agentic AI** systems remain value-aligned and transparent; (ii) synthesizing partial perspectives into a **shared understanding** for patients and clinicians; and (iii) minimizing the **cognitive load** of health technologies for users with diverse levels of literacy.

Driven by a commitment to equity, I employ mixed-methods approaches to design systems that support, rather than burden, vulnerable stakeholders. I am currently **seeking PhD positions** for **Fall 2026** to further investigate how we can build intelligent interfaces that honor the complexity of care work.
