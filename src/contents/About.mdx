Hi! I’m **Elara Liu**, a second-year MSCS student at **Northwestern University** advised by **Karan Ahuja** and **Haoqi Zhang**. I earned an honors B.S. from **UC Irvine** with a double major in Computer Science and Informatics. I work at the intersection of Human–AI Interaction, agentic LLM systems and tool use, and wearable sensing for health.

Some reminders help; others get in the way. I study how intelligent systems can support long-term habits without hijacking attention. My focus is **boundary-aware**, **habit-forming JITAI agents**: systems that learn when not to interrupt, **fade** assistance as people gain skill, and make **re-entry** after lapses feel natural.

Methodologically, I work end-to-end—designing interfaces; building tool-using agents; doing wearable and mobile sensing; context-aware computation—and running mixed-method evaluations. My toolkit spans Python and TypeScript/React, with an accessibility-first mindset (WCAG/ARIA) and open, reproducible code and analyses.

I’m applying to PhD programs for **Fall 2026** in labs that blend **HCI, Human–AI Interaction, wearables, and digital/mobile health**. If your group works at this intersection, I’d love to connect.
