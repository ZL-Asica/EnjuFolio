Hi, I’m **Elara Liu**, a second-year MSCS student at **Northwestern University**, advised by **Dr. Karan Ahuja** and **Dr. Haoqi Zhang**. I work at the intersection of **Human–Computer Interaction**, **human-centered AI**, and **everyday health**, building systems that support people living with chronic conditions and the caregivers and clinicians around them. I previously earned a B.S. in Computer Science and Informatics from **UC Irvine**.

My research asks how **intelligent systems** can turn the messy, everyday experience of chronic conditions—symptoms, energy, attention, routines, and risk—into **shared, understandable, and actionable representations**. I am especially motivated by the gap between the fragmented data we already collect in everyday life—**wearables**, **apps and device logs**, **patient portals**, and **personal narratives**—and the shared understanding patients, caregivers, and clinicians need to stay “on the same page.” Methodologically, I design and build **interactive systems** and **interpretive tools** that help people make sense of longitudinal health data and support reflection, coordination, and decision-making.

I care especially about the long-term **safety**, **psychological impact**, and **governance** of these systems: how they explain themselves, how they respect people’s goals and constraints, and when they should defer to human judgment and clinical care. I’m applying to **Fall 2026 PhD** programs in labs that blend **HCI**, **human–AI interaction**, and **health and well-being** across empirical studies, system design, and AI capabilities. If your group works at these intersections, I’d love to connect.
