Hi! I’m **Elara Liu**, a second-year MSCS student at **Northwestern University** advised by **Karan Ahuja**. I work at the intersection of **Human–AI Interaction**, **agentic LLM systems & tool use**, and **wearable sensing for health**.

I like to **build end-to-end systems**—from interfaces and retrieval/LLM backends to instrumentation, logging, and analysis—and then **evaluate** how reliably and safely they support people. Recent themes in my work include **constraint-aligned agents** that respect hardware/operational limits, **IR-driven sensemaking** for comparing concepts across contexts, and **cross-dataset benchmarks** for **IMU-based activity recognition**.

Methodologically, I span **prototyping**, **study design/piloting**, **dataset curation**, and **evaluation** (task metrics and human ratings). On the engineering side, I work in **Python/TypeScript**, **React/Next.js**, **Hono/Bun/FastAPI**, and pragmatic **LLM evaluation**. I care about **accessibility** (WCAG/ARIA) and **reproducibility** in open source. I also enjoy teaching and community building (e.g., teaching assistant; previously led a 130-member volunteer subtitling group -- BelugaSubs).

I’m applying to **PhD programs (Fall 2026)** in groups that blend **HCI**, **system building**, and **health**. If our interests align, I’d love to contact with you via the second email button on the right below.
