  HCI health research often focuses on the patient, treating caregivers as background infrastructure rather than active users. This systematic review analyzes how caregivers are recruited, represented, and designed for across the HCI corpus. By mapping patterns of power, clinical authority, and interdependence, we articulate how current methods obscure the relational nature of care and offer a framework for more equitable caregiver involvement.

## The Challenge

In health-related HCI, the "user" is often conceptualized as a solitary individual managing a condition. However, real-world care is relational: it happens between patients, families, and clinicians. When research methodologies treat caregivers merely as proxies for patient data or as "informal supporters," they risk reinforcing **clinical hierarchies** and obscuring the **invisible labor** required to make health technologies work in domestic settings.

## Methodology

Working with [Dr. Hee Rin Lee](https://www.heerinlee.com/), I co-led a **codebook-based systematic review** with [Jun Zhu](https://jz-jun.github.io/) to examine the structural role of caregivers in HCI literature. We moved beyond simple keyword matching to perform a deep qualitative coding of study designs.

Our process involved:

- **Corpus Construction:** Aggregating a broad dataset of papers from CHI, CSCW, and related venues that involve care dyads or triads.
- **Iterative Codebook Development:** In dual-coder sessions, we treated ambiguous labels—e.g., "family member," "carer," "primary user"—as analytical signals. We refined our codebook to capture _how_ these roles were defined by researchers versus how they functioned in practice.
- **Dimensions of Analysis:** We specifically coded for recruitment strategies (dyadic vs. individual), the directionality of care (one-way burden vs. reciprocal exchange), and the attribution of expertise (lived experience vs. clinical authority).

## Sample Codebook

To operationalize "care" and "power," we developed a hierarchical coding scheme. Below is an excerpt of the dimensions used to map stakeholder relationships and epistemic authority across the corpus.

| **Power & Epistemic Authority**  | Whose knowledge leads the design process?

## Emerging Themes

We are currently synthesizing our findings into a taxonomy of caregiver involvement. Early analysis reveals three critical tensions in the field:

1.  **Instrumental vs. Relational Roles**
    Many studies consult caregivers only as "informants" to gather requirements for the patient, ignoring the caregiver's own needs and the mutual negotiation of care.

2.  **Reproduction of Clinical Power**
    We found that technologies often implicitly encode medical authority, prioritizing data compliance over the lived realities of the home, thereby turning caregivers into "enforcers" of clinical regimens.

3.  **Conflict and Negotiation**
    Few studies design for the inevitable conflicts between caregivers and recipients (e.g., privacy vs. safety). We are identifying best practices from papers that successfully surface and design for these tensions.

## Impact

This work aims to provide concrete guidance for future HCI health research. By making power relations visible, we offer a framework for recruiting and reporting on caregivers as **entangled actors**. Our goal is to shift the field toward methods that acknowledge care not as a one-directional service, but as a complex, interdependent relationship.
