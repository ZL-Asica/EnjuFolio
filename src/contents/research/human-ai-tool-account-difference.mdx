  I led an HCI/NLP project that validates how the same place categories afford different experiences across U.S. regions using Yelp reviews and guidebook priors. The work demonstrates that "regional experiential signatures"—like king cake, picon punch, or tax-free shopping—are systematically encoded in user-generated text, revealing geographic meaning shifts that current category-based recommenders overlook.

## Overview

Working with my advisor Haoqi, I investigated how place imprints experience differently across regions. Drawing on travel guidebooks and HCI theories of "space versus place," I operationalized narrative claims, such as King Cake being routine in Louisiana but "imported" in Pennsylvania, into testable hypotheses. By comparing how concretely and frequently specific experience phrases appear in reviews for the _same_ Yelp category across states, I could hold categories constant to reveal geographic meaning shifts, interpreting results through a framework of **environmental, cultural, social, and institutional drivers**.

To validate this hypothesis, I conducted a **comparative analysis** using the Yelp Open Dataset across thirteen U.S. states. I aggregated reviews by (state, category) pairs, extracted n-gram phrases, and computed TF–IDF salience to quantify regional distinctiveness. I iteratively refined extraction thresholds to filter noise while preserving meaningful practice-related language. Crucially, I paired every statistical contrast with ranked review snippets to audit whether detected differences reflected intended experiences rather than incidental word usage.

The analysis demonstrates that review language reliably encodes **regional experiential signatures**, validating that these differences are recoverable and interpretable from user-generated text. This finding opens pathways for future design: interfaces that expose experiential contrasts alongside ratings, context-aware defaults informed by regional context, and transparent evidence grounding recommendations in actual user descriptions.

## Selected visuals

| Category           | Region    | Surfaced phrase (experience)              | Dominant driver |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Farmers' Markets   | California | **local avocado** as signature product   | Environmental   |
| Bakeries           | Louisiana  | **king cake** as a routine               | Cultural        |
| Basque restaurants | Nevada     | **picon punch** as a pre-dinner ritual   | Social          |
| Outlet malls       | Delaware   | **no sales tax** / cross-border shopping | Institutional   |

Each row shows how, by holding the Yelp category fixed and contrasting review phrases across states, we recover distinct _regional experiential signatures_ interpreted through our four-driver vocabulary.
