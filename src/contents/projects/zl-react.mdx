## Abstract

`@zl-asica/react` is a small, TypeScript-first library of hooks and utilities designed for production React apps that need predictable behavior across server and client. The project separates **SSR-safe utilities** from browser-bound hooks, ships **API docs generated from types**, and distributes **signed builds** with a 100% JSR score and multi-runtime compatibility (Cloudflare Workers, Node, Bun, browsers). Versioned releases are archived for citation.

## Design Rationale

- **Ergonomics via types.** API surfaces encode intent (e.g., typed event maps in `useEventListener`), reducing foot-guns and cutting boilerplate in everyday tasks like input handling, viewport checks, and storage state.
- **Clarity over cleverness.** Each hook or helper does one thing (e.g., `useArray`, `useDebouncedCallback`, `useIntersectionObserver`), with names aligned to mental models you already use in UI work.
- **Provenance.** Publicly hosted API references are generated from source and show file origins (e.g., “Defined in: …/useArray.ts”), making behavior auditable—useful for teaching, code reviews, and replication.

## System Overview

**Server–Client boundary.** The library codifies SSR constraints up front. Hooks that rely on the DOM live on the client; **SSR-safe utilities** (no `window`/`document`, no DOM-lifecycle coupling) are exported under `@zl-asica/react/utils`. This avoids runtime checks scattered through app code and clarifies what can execute on the server.

**Typed surface area.** API pages show generics and precise parameter types (e.g., `useEventListener<KW,KH,KM,T>`), encouraging compile-time correctness for event names/targets/options.

**Distribution & portability.** Releases are **built and signed on GitHub Actions**, published to **JSR** (npm-compatible install), and score **100%** on JSR’s quality checks. Runtime badges indicate compatibility across **Cloudflare Workers, Node, Bun, and browsers**.

**Archival.** Tagged versions are mirrored on **Zenodo** for stable academic citations.

## API Surface at a Glance

- **Async:** `useAsync`, `useFetch`, `usePolling`
- **DOM / viewport:** `useEventListener`, `useInViewport`, `useIntersectionObserver`, `useHideOnScrollDown`, `useKeyPress`, `useWindowSize`, `useScrollPosition`
- **State / UX:** `useArray`, `useBoolean`, `useCounter`, `useDebounce`, `useDebouncedCallback`, `useLocalStorage`, `useSessionStorage`, `useThrottle`, `useTimeout`, `useToggle`, `useTheme`
- **Utilities (SSR-safe module available):** arrays/objects/dates/strings/math/DOM helpers (e.g., `assignUUID`, `mapRange`, `mergeObjects`, `truncateToNearestWord`, `getRelativeDay`).

## Engineering Choices

![Figure 2: JSR Score 100% badges](/images/projects/zl-react/jsr-badges.png)

- **TypeDoc-generated API**: Reference pages are compiled from the TypeScript source, preserving signatures and source locations (“Defined in …”). This supports code review, onboarding, and reproducible usage examples.
- **Performance discipline**: The project markets a “Performance-Driven” stance—keep bundles small, avoid bloat—appropriate for design-heavy sites where reader experience matters.
- **Portability by default**: JSR distribution provides a clean path to multi-runtime installs (npm compatibility layer), and the package page explicitly flags supported environments.
- **Ecosystem visibility**: The package is available under your npm scope as well, which eases discovery for teams standardizing on npm registries.

## Example of Typed Ergonomics

![Figure 4: useEventListener type signature with generics and event maps](/images/projects/zl-react/useeventlistener.png)

Typed parameters constrain the event name to known keys (`WindowEventMap` / `HTMLElement` events) and the target to specific refs. This is a small but impactful HCI choice: **the UI affordance (add a listener) matches the API affordance (pick a valid event/target)**, with compile-time feedback instead of runtime surprises.

## Positioning in the Hooks Landscape

Many hook libraries focus on breadth of utilities. `@zl-asica/react` emphasizes **server awareness**, **typed surfaces**, and **auditable docs**—a useful stance for research and production websites alike. (For context, other libraries now also advertise “server-safe hooks,” suggesting a converging best practice.)
