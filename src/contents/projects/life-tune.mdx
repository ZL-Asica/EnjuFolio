  I led a small team to design and implement LifeTune, an iOS health app that turns fragmented fitness, nutrition, sleep, and mood data into a single “health score” with small, actionable suggestions, grounded in competitive analysis, interviews with four user groups, and iterative SwiftUI prototyping focused on simplification, routine fit, and motivation.

## Overview

LifeTune started from a simple tension I kept hearing in conversations with health-conscious friends: they were willing to track, but most apps buried them in numbers and charts. As team lead, I framed the design problem as **how to reduce data overload while still giving people enough signal to act**, and our team treated it as both an HCI and systems question. After a quick competitive analysis of existing assessment and tracking tools, we ran interviews with four groups—health enthusiasts, experienced app users, developers of health tech, and self-identified “tech-haters”—to understand not just what they logged, but where current tools broke down in their everyday routines.

Across these interviews, a few patterns kept resurfacing: people wanted someone to “just tell me what to eat” instead of counting every calorie; sleep tools that could explain patterns without demanding new rituals; feedback that celebrated progress instead of nagging; and mental-health support that translated mood logs into concrete suggestions. I synthesized these into a set of design commitments: **simplify** complex data into a single health score with clear levers, **fit into existing routines** rather than invent new ones, and **motivate through visible progress** while still acknowledging emotional state.

On the technical side, I translated these commitments into an end-to-end **SwiftUI app**. LifeTune aggregates inputs on activity, nutrition, sleep, and mood into a composite score that updates as users log small actions—a short walk, a better meal choice—so the interface can show how each decision moves the needle. The UI uses a compact, card-based layout and gentle visual cues instead of dense dashboards, and the recommendation layer surfaces a small set of next steps rather than long to-do lists. I iterated from mid-fidelity flows to high-fidelity prototypes and finally a working iOS implementation, revising interactions whenever testers reported confusion or found themselves ignoring features. The result is less a numbers app and more a **health companion** that tries to make “what should I do next?” legible for people at very different levels of comfort with health tech.
