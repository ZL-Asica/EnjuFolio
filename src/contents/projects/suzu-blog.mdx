## Abstract

SuzuBlog is a Next.js–based blog system designed for maintainability and reader ergonomics rather than CMS feature bloat. The project favors **file-based authorship** (Markdown + YAML frontmatter), a **single-site config** (`config.yml`) for policy and branding, and a deployment model that keeps output **fully static** by default. The result is a minimalist personal blog with clear provenance, predictable performance, and low operational overhead.

## Design Rationale

- **Reading first.** Typography, spacing, and navigation are intentionally quiet; the sakura-inspired theme keeps cognitive load low and rhythm consistent across devices. Docs foreground “Sakura (Cherry Blossom) Themes” and accessibility-aware defaults.
- **Content provenance.** Every post is a file with explicit frontmatter. Policy toggles (e.g., license, comments) are visible and auditable in version control.
- **International reach.** i18n is configuration-led. Language strings and metadata adapt via `config.yml`, enabling multilingual personal sites without per-page boilerplate.
- **Assistive defaults.** Semantic HTML and generated meta (sitemap/OG/Twitter/JSON-LD) are part of the template’s baseline, supporting discoverability and assistive tech.

## System Overview

**Architecture.**

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.
- **Content model:** Markdown posts with YAML frontmatter. Special pages live under `_pages` (e.g., About, Friends).
- **Configuration:** `config.yml` is the single source of truth for SEO, social links, language, analytics, special pages, and integrations.
- **Build & delivery:** Targets SSG/ISR for predictable speed and hosting portability.

**Operational ergonomics.**

- **Template sync.** A GitHub Action (“Sync SuzuBlog Main Branch”) keeps downstream sites in step with template updates while protecting content and config—useful for long-lived academic pages.
- **Release hygiene.** Versioned releases document changes (e.g., SEO/JSON-LD improvements; code highlighting via Shiki), aiding reproducibility and citation.

## Configuration-as-Policy

![Figure 2: Excerpt of config.yml showing site/i18n](/images/projects/suzublog/config.png)

**Single-file governance.** SuzuBlog centralizes site policy in `config.yml`, which covers:

- **Site identity & meta:** title/description/keywords, author, canonical URL.
- **i18n knobs:** language code and localized naming; optional AniList page under `/about/anime`.
- **Comments:** choice of Disqus or self-hostable Twikoo, enabled by two keys (no code edits).
- **Custom head/footer & scripts:** controlled injection points for analytics or research pixels—kept explicit and versioned.

This approach preserves **auditability** (changes are diffs), encourages **principled defaults**, and avoids hidden runtime state common in CMS plugins.

## LLM Readiness & Content Stewardship

SuzuBlog can emit an **`/llms.txt`** file to guide assistant crawlers toward canonical, plain-text sources—an emerging convention analogous (but not identical) to `robots.txt`. This strengthens **content provenance** for AI tools without adding authoring burden. The feature shipped in v1.9.0 and aligns with current community proposals around llms.txt semantics ([Check what is `llms.txt`](https://llmstxt.org/)).

## Performance & Reliability

![Figure 4: Lighthouse](/images/projects/suzublog/lighthouse.png)

- **Static by default** → fast TTFB and stable render path.
- **Deterministic builds** → simple rollbacks, easy diffs, and predictable performance envelopes.
- **Minimal JS at rest** → the template favors content over interactivity unless explicitly requested in a post/page.

## Extensibility

![Figure 5: Plug-in points — comments, social cards, analytics](/images/projects/suzublog/plug-in-points.png)

- **Pluggable comments:** Disqus or Twikoo via config flags; it’s trivial to disable for research pages that disallow public discussion.
- **Programmable pages:** Simple data-driven sections (e.g., Friends) render from structured content files.
- **Theme surface:** Tokenizable Tailwind layer keeps design swaps localized.

## Security & Privacy Posture

- **No admin panel, no server session** by default → smaller attack surface.
- **Explicit embeds only** (e.g., comments/analytics via config) → easy to review and strip for compliance.
- **Provenance via Git** → every public change is reviewable.

## Use Cases on an Academic Portfolio

- **Research notes & preprints** with clear licensing and metadata.
- **Project showcases** where each page doubles as a reproducible artifact (files + config).
- **Teaching** pages that benefit from static, long-lived links and minimal maintenance.
